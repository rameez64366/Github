 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.

 Material number 2 (used by element 3233) should normally have at least  
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.

 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by

 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 9.891502726E-04 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.

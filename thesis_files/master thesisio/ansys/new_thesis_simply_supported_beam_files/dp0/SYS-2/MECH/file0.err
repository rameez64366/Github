 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.

 Material number 2 (used by element 609) should normally have at least   
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.

 Material number 2 (used by element 609) should normally have at least   
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.

 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 1.457916591E-03 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.
